Option 1:  Identify a particular physical discipline whose purpose is to improve the body’s ability to perform in a particular arena. The paper should argue for this discipline’s effectiveness in promoting the physical skill necessary in the field it seeks to address. This could be a discipline that explores a spiritual path (such as intense meditation, yoga or zen walking), a performance skill (such as a dance form or acrobatics) an athletic pursuit or any other relevant physical discipline. The paper should include description of the discipline itself.

American Physical Education focus on certain aspects like strength and cardiovascular endurance, but Tai Chi offers that and much more. Even though Tai Chi is known to be slow, it is effective in building the body to be more powerful and enduring.  Tai Chi has many other benefits for the body like better posture and prevention of many illnesses. The practice is also good for the mind because it puts it in a meditative state. Currently, Tai Chi is known to be martial arts for the elderly even though its benefits are best when it is practiced at an early age. Tai Chi should be taught in American school because it is better for the body and mind of students than current physical education practices and it reduces their stress levels, leading to a more productive society.Tai Chi is a martial art that can help to prevent and treat many medical problems and exercise the body. The discipline focuses on precise, slow movements of the body to perform various forms for self-defense and to practice the movement of an energy called chi. Tai Chi is often performed in the morning, usually with other people. When doing Tai Chi, the mind should be focused and devoid of extraneous thoughts. As such, “Tai chi is often described as ‘meditation in motion,’ but it might well [also] be called ‘medication in motion.’”(Harvard Health, The health benefits of tai chi) That is because nowadays, Tai Chi is known for the many medical benefits that it provides. The practice of Tai Chi has shown to help prevent and treat various medical conditions that are prevalent in the world today. Frequent practice of Tai Chi can help with problems like Arthritis, Breast Cancer, Diabetes, and many heart problems. It also improves people’s posture and alleviates back pain. Besides of its medical benefits, Tai Chi is a potent way to tone the body. It simultaneously exercises many muscles throughout the body because it makes people shift their weight and hold their weight in a certain position. The great thing about Tai Chi is that even though it looks slow and easy, it is still effective in working out the body. Harvard Health found that “people who did tai chi improved more than 30% in lower-body strength and 25% in arm strength — almost as much as those who participated in resistance training, and more than those assigned to brisk walking.” (The health benefits of tai chi) This makes Tai Chi more efficient than practices like weight lifting, which can injure certain muscles of the body, stunt the growth of students, or cause their bodies to look disproportioned. Since Tai Chi can still maintain the physical vigor of Physical Education, the practice should be offered as an alternative to traditional Physical Education classes because it can offer other benefits as well. Tai Chi can improve aspects like balance and flexibility. Tai Chi can also help the student clear their minds for class because its practice is almost like meditation in that it involves emptying the mind of irrelevant things and focusing on the body. Students can forget about hard things and allocate their focus on their studies. The body can also receive more oxygen and maintain better blood flow since Tai Chi emphasizes focus of the breath. These factors can help students focus in their studies better than exhausting exercises like running or sports, which make students too tired to learn or too hyper to pay attention. However, since Tai Chi is low impact and do not use weights, it is much more inclusive than regular exercising. People who are overweight or too weak to participate in traditional exercises can still train their bodies through Tai Chi. Students would try to work their bodies rather think of ways to get out of having to exercise.Through an increase in the practice of Tai Chi, America can develop to a society that is more efficient and productive.” ‘If we provided tools like tai chi … through public education, every kid could be graduating high school as a tai chi or yoga master,' Douglas [, tai chi teacher and founder of World Tai Chi & Qigong Day,] says. 'This could conceivably save hundreds of billions of dollars, not once, but every year’“(Sarnataro, Tai Chi Exercises Both Mind and Body). This is because Tai Chi’s meditative-like mindset is very effective at reducing stress. In fact, “according to some estimates, unmanaged stress could be costing U.S. businesses billions each year”(Sarnataro, Tai Chi Exercises Both Mind and Body) By relieving individuals from stress, America can be more productive and friendlier. Tai Chi can also help individuals who have sleep problems. “In a University of California, Los Angeles, study of 112 healthy older adults with moderate sleep complaints, 16 weeks of tai chi improved the quality and duration of sleep significantly more than standard sleep education“(Harvard Health, The health benefits of tai chi). With better sleep, society will have more productivity and fewer accidents. With all of these benefits, the only reason that Tai Chi is not popular is because its slow movements are not as flashy as other martial arts, so people associate the practice exclusively to the elderly. However, if the practice was taught in school, students can learn that anyone can learn and practice Tai Chi. They can learn that, despite popular beliefs, it is better for people to learn Tai Chi when they are young. Harvard Health states, “the benefits of tai chi are generally greatest if you begin before you develop a chronic illness or functional limitations” (The health benefits of tai chi). If students were taught Tai Chi in school, they can start practicing the art at a younger age and prevent these diseases from developing and becoming a problem at a later age. The practice of Tai Chi at a young age can also promote the push hands, the Tai Chi practice where two people practice with each other by redirecting each other’s hands. “The push hands is a more vigorous exercise and chances are only those who learned as children, or young adults, will excel at this” (Phillips, Can Children Learn Tai Chi?) This practice can promote Tai Chi in a competitive scene so that it is more popular with younger people.Once Tai Chi is popular, there is no reason that America should not teach Tai Chi as a subject in school. Tai Chi is a martial art that is healthy for the body and has little to no negative side effects. It can help to prevent and treat a multitude of illnesses that are common in America. Even though it is slow and low impact, Tai Chi is effective in exercising the body in all areas. Its calm nature can also help students with their studies and reduce their stress. In the long term, an increase in the practice of Tai Chi would increase the productivity and decrease accidents in America. It’s high time that the practice of Tai Chi should move from just the Recreation Center and the elderly to the general public.
