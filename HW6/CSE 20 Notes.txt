In a party there are 2n people. They shake hand with each other such that there is no triangle.
ex. A shakes hands with B and B shakes hand with C, then A does not shake hand with C.
Prove that number of hand shakes <= n^2.

n=1  	o———o		# of handshakes <= 1 = 1^2
n=2     o—-—o	o———o 	# of handshakes = 4 = 2^2
          X	|   |
        o——-o   o———o

BC	n=1     
IH	Let for some k, P(k) is true.
IS	WTS P(k+1) is true.
	2(k+1) = 2k + 2
	WTS number of handshake <= (k+1)^2

   a(k) b(k)

Number of total handshakes <= 1 + a + b + k^2
			   <= 1 + 2k + k^2 = (k+1)^2
