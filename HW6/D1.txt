June 12 - Day 1
It’s move out day. This is the first day of summer for me. The suite threw me a birthday party for when its my birthday. I had no idea that they were going to do that. I got so many league skins as presents as well. They are amazing. The leaving was also very sad. I wish I had more time with them or even spent my time with them better. Well I will make sure I do that next year. Going home was exciting as well. It was a beautiful night with the honeymoon and the family took me to eat hotpot and escargot. It was the first time I genuinely try the coconut snails. I’m excited for the summer— there are so many things that I want to learn!

June 13 - Day 2
I packed out the stuff from the dorms— although there are still some left. It is more crowded now. We ate summer rolls. They started telling me to get job/classes like expected.
